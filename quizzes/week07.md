# Advanced Front-End Frameworks


**1.** Describe the two ways to bind Data in Vue?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
        One way is with v-bind and can be used inside a variable, and the other is with {{}} in html.
```

**2.** The `SPA` acronym stands for what?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
        Single-Page-Application
```
**3.** What are some of the advantages/uses of a `SPA` over a traditional one?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
        With SPA you only use one page and update different parts of it when necessary. This can make things faster because there is less to load each time a change occurs.
```
**4.** What does the `onMounted` method in Vue do?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
        onMounted causes something to occur as soon as the page is loaded.
```
**5.** What is the `v-model` attribute in Vue for, and when might you use it?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
        v-model is for data binding forms. You use it when you need to take the information inputted in a form and use that data.
```
**6.** The `v:on` (`@`) directive can be used for what?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
        v:on or @ is used to trigger something to happen when an element is interacted with. It can trigger something to happen on a click of a button.
```
**7.** Which Vue attributes(directives) could you use to conditionally render elements on a page?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
        v-if and v-else can cause an element to render on certain instances, and a different element to render on the opposite. V-show can say that an element is always rendered until css-based toggle.
```
**8.** What is the purpose of the `key` attribute when using `v-for` on an element?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
        The key attribute helps to determine a unique value on each object in an array in order to know how many elements need a v-for. 
```
**9.** What is the `<slot>` element and what is it used for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
        The slot is a placeholder where something else can be plugged in. For example, a modal with a title-slot and a body-slot can be used for multiple things, plugging in a different form or words to the slots for each instance of the modal.
