# UnderStanding Asynchronous Code, and API's

**1.** What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

        Asynchronous code is a code that doesn't happen right away but can be triggered to happen at a later time or is something that will take time but doesn't stop the code processing.
```

```
**3.** What does the `O` represent in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

        Open-closed principle, meaning that functions should be allowed to be added upon but shouldn't be modified in a way that changes a lot of your other code.
```
**4.** What is a callback / higher order function?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

        It is a function that is passed to another function as a parameter and then the function takes place inside this other function.
```
**5.** What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

        A promise is when a function goes to do something and code pauses until that is either successful or fails. You get an error is the promise is unsuccessful.
```
