```
**3.** What are the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
        S- single responsibility (a function should only have one job)
        O- open closed
        L- Liskov substitution
        I- Interface segregation
        D- Dependency Inversion
```
**4.** Given this array: 
```js
let fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'pineapple',  'orange', 'strawberry']
``` 
What index is the pineapple's current position? How do you know?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```
**5.** With these two objects: 
```js
let you = { name:"You", hair: true, friends: [] }
let them = { name:"Them", hair: false, friends: [] }
```
how would you .push the `them` object into the `you` object's array of friends?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

```

**6.** Give an example of a JavaScript `Conditional`:
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
        if(a + b == C){
          console.log("correct")
        }
```
**7.** In the `for loop` below, what is the name of the piece belongs inside the empty "______" space? What would you put here to increase `i` by one on every iteration?
```js
for ( let i = 0; i < arr.length; _______ ) {
  //...
```
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
        To increase i by one on every iteration you would put i++ in the empty space. This piece of the for loop is called the increment.
```
**8.** What does the `DOM` acronym stand for? Which file is first accessed to render the `DOM`?

        A parameter is what a function requires to be passed into it. The argument is what you actually pass into the function in the place of the parameter when the function is invoked.
```
**11.** What is the difference between a `primitive` value and a `reference` value?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

        A primitive value has one specific value such as a number, a string, or a boolean. A reference value contains references to multiple values like an object.
