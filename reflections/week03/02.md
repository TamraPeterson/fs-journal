## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

        The purpose of encapsulation is to bundle data and the methods that deal with that data into a place where the data can't be accessed outside of the object. This way only the stated methods and objects have access to it to change it.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

        The underscore prefix is a convention that not everyone knows about so it can confuse people. 

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

        When we encapsulate data we can keep it private from other files by not exporting it. This encapsulation allows for us to store data that can't be accessed by the user.
