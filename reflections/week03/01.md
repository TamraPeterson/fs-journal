## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

        It makes it so that you don't have to rewrite a function for other files to access it. You can export the data to other files and not have to rewrite your code.

2. How does export differ from export default?

        I honestly don't know. I've read over it a few times and don't understand the difference. ðŸ¤¨

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

        Some benefits are that you can break your code up into smaller files for more organization, and debugging is easier. You can also concatenate multiple scripts to increase performance.
