## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

       1- get- the get operation gets the value of a key. & 2- set- an operation to set a new key to an object.

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?

        You have to pass the obj and the prop through the get function. This way the get operator takes in the object itself and the property being accessed and returns both.

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

        One benefit of using a proxy object is that we can prevent certain properties from being accessed on an object. We can set a 'trap' to determine when a certain thing is being done and throw an error or prevent that thing from happening.
