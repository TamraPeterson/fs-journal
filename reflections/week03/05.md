# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

      Team building and enjoying the struggles together.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

      Javascript files for days...It's very overwhelming and to learn that we'll have many many more in the future is crazy.

- What are you struggling with?

      I'm still struggling with the MVC pattern and getting all the files to talk to each other without looking at past code and doing what's there. 

- What would you count as a victory?

      Completing my checkpoint without bleeding.
