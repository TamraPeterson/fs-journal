## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

        Base64 is used to represent binary data in text format. It is an encoding schema to store data when embedding an image into a database.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

        Base64 can increase file size more than 25%, causes the browser to have to decode the strings and images causing unnecessary work. Base64 also causes a load on the server and increases bandwidth because the browser cant store the image locally.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

        Years ago web browsers had limits on how many connections they could send to a server so a website wiht lots of images needed to wait for all the images to load. Base64 helped work around that, but now it causes extra work and effort that actually makes things worse.
