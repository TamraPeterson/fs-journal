## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

        We have used figma for the layout of our site, postman for testing, and vue for everything else. We reference bootstrap documentation and google for ideas and help with issues. We have even referenced other sites just for ideas of layouts and user experience. We're using some scrum to make sure we have standups and communicate frequently about the progress and needs we have. 

2. What went well so far?

        Our group has had good communication and worked well together. When we need help we ask each other for input, we switch off when we need to, we try to remind each other to take breaks, and everyone's been supportive of each others ideas and needs.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

        On day one, most of our group worked on finishing their checkpoint, so one other group member and I designed the figma and the basic layout for our project. We put a lot of time into it and I think I got attached to it so when everyone joined us the next day and wanted to change a lot of it, it felt kind of personal. I think I would've preferred for us all to plan together from the beginning so that the idea could evolve from the culmination of all of our ideas. But I did learn to not get attached to something that isn't my own project because of course plans are going to change and ideas will evolve.
