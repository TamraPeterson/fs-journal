## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

        Unit testing, component testing, and End-to-end testing. Unit testing is where you test individual units of code on their own. Component testing is testing a component for functionality, which may involve more unites of code. End-to-end testing is testing what a user will experience while using your app. 

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

        I think that testing components may be the most useful because it narrows down the scope of what could be found wrong, but is a little more about multiple units of code and how they might work together. 

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

        I think the end to end could be more difficult to catch all the bugs and issues because things could easily be missed. But it does make sense to test from the user point of view in order to find what may be buggy for users.
