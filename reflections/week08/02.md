## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

        Communication can help teams work more effectively and efficiently. It assures that everyone on the team is aware of the responsibilities, feels they are heard and cared about, and that people are able to understand each other better.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

        Having more regular communication via online chat helped teams reduce how often and for how long they had meetings beacuse they were always communicating and had less they needed to discuss during meetings.

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

        This is when a deadline is approaching and the team has to balance between their speed and the quality of the product. One side is good service, cheap, but not fast. The second is good service, fast, but not cheap. The last is fast and cheap service, but not good.
