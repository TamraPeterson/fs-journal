## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

        A developer portfolio provides a place where a dev can show off the work they've done, show their skills, and increase their reputation. It can help a dev stand out for a job and show an employer what they're capable of.

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

        An effective portfolio would ideally have 4 or 5 high quality projects, a variety, apps you've built that are relevant to your life or to the business you're interviewing for, things you care about.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

        At this point I think I would include my Tower checkpoint, because that is the first time I built a full stack app on my own and I'm proud of having done it. I know it isn't top notch, but it shows what I was able to learn in 2 months. I also hope to include our capstone project because it shows a collaborative effort and is an app I would actually like to have.
