# Daily Reflection
This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely? 

## Prompts
- How is today going? 

        I'm feeling pretty good today. I've made good progress and don't feel too worried about time.

- Are you managing your stress?

        Yes, I do need to take more breaks though.

- What has you most worried?

        I am most worried about the many to many and the table joining for that. I don't think I fully understand the join.
