# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 

        Today is good. I finished my project and passed my grading. Yay!

- Are you managing your stress?

        Yes, I haven't been feeling too stressed but when I think about interviews next week I get stressed.

- What has you most worried?

        I'm worried about whiteboard challenges and showing I know what I'm doing with coding because my mind goes blank when I'm put on the spot.
