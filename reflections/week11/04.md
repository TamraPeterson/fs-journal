## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

        I have thoroughly enjoyed this course and all that I've learned. I can't believe its ending so soon! I'm a little concerned with some concepts that I don't think are solidified in my brain yet, but I'm excited to land a job and be able to have the time to focuse in and hopefully gain a more solid understanding. I think I've learned the most from the checkpoints. Having to work through a project start to finish on my own has helped me learn the most and has been enjoyable, despite being sometimes stressful. 
        For the final I plan to try to take breaks more than I typically do. I feel like we have plenty of time so it will be a good opportunity to try to pace myself. I'm hoping to get as much of the back end done as possible before starting front end, but to not get too stuck on tests I can't pass.
