## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

        A primary key is the key on a table that is used to identify unique rows. A foreign key is a reference to another table's key.

2. What is an `Alias`?

        An alias is a temporary name you give to a column when joining tables in order to have cleaner code and simplify.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

        SELECT 
          p.*
          dp.*
          FROM dpatients dp
          JOIN patients p ON p.id = dp.patientId
          JOIN doctors d ON d.id = dp.doctorId
          WHERE dp.doctorId = d.id

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE dpatients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```
