## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

        When a class inherits from another class it allows us to resuse code without having to type it out. It gives the class that inherits access to all the information from the parent class.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

        No, constructors can't ever be inherited and neither are finalizers. But everything else is inherited. And if another class inherits from a child of another, it will inherit the information from the parent's parent as well.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

        If a member is listed as private then it can't be inherited by child components.
