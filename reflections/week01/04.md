## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

        Wireframing is the process of planning the layout of your website. It helps you to interact with the customer and gain feedback and make tweaks so that you have a good idea of what you'll need to build out later. 

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

        Low-fidelity wireframes are super simple sketches of what the site will generally look like. 
        Mid-fidelity wireframes are cleaner and more styled than low-fid and sometimes include placeholders for photos and more to-scale sizing.
        High-fidelity wireframes are very detailed and often include actual photos, colors, and specific measurments.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

        I think they are super helpful in allowing for communication between a developer/designer and the customer. They help the developer know what features will be useful and what won't. They also serve as almost a map towards the end product, breaking it down into do-able steps.
