# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

        Working with a partner was actually a really good exercise. I could see how it would be difficult to work on a team where there isn't a lot of communication but fortunately my partner and I worked well together and I feel like we had a lot of success building our site.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

      I love the wireframing concept. It makes so much sense to outline the site before getting started. Figma seems like an amazing tool, but it will definitely take some practice to get to the point where it is actually saving me time. 

- What are you struggling with?

        I'm not always sure what I'm supposed to be doing each night to be prepared for the next day and am not always sure where to find all the resources 

- What would you count as a victory?
