## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

        I like the ease of adding a border color to one side of an element to add subtle variation on the page. I also think that the button variations will be useful when trying to emphasize the buttons you want the user to click, vs buttons that aren't as important.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

        https://www.quotery.com/ <<I really like the look of this website. The home page is just one big picture with two clickable options. It's very user-friendly and the layout of the quotes on the next page utilizes color to organize the various containers.
        https://www.brinkerhoffpoetry.org/ <<Again I like the simple layout of this site where everything is squared off and in containers. It has some nice scrolling features as well.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

        If a page is designed well it is easy to find what you're looking for on the page. I think that by using the tips on priority buttons, you can help guide users to the button they likely need to use. Emphasizing different elements with bolder text or catchier colors will grab the users' attention and make naturally draw them to the areas they are most likely trying to find.
