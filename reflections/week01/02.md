## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

        Pseudo-classes are ways to target selectors in a certain state. Useful pseudo-classes might be :first-child, :last-child to target the first p or last p.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

        Specificity is how specific a selector is. The more specific a selector is, the higher priority it receives. When you use a specific selector you can target one element that already might fall under another selector and override that selector's property.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

        It wouldn't be clear which class was first priority and !important would lose its meaning.
