## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

        We use Git to store code so that multiple developers can work on a project and prevent conflicts in their code. We can also see what changes have been made over time and revert back to older code.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

        With multiple branches we are able to upload multiple developers' code and the updated commits of each.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

        GitHub is where developers can push their code to a remote repository so that others can see their code.
