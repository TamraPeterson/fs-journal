## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

      With a query string you can pass information to and from a website by adding that information to the end of the URL. The website then receives that information by reading the URL.

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

        A query parameter is formated like so: key=value. Multiple parameters are separated by '&' like so: key=value&key2=value2

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

        Query parameters might be helpful to help narrow down the results you get from the server. You can pass multiple values to help you only get back the information on things with those requirements.
