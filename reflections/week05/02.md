## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

        One-to-One (each side only has each other, monogamy), One-to-Many (one side can have more than one relationship and the other only has the one, infidelity), and Many-to-Many (each side can have multiple relationships, polyamory).

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

        Linking things has the advantage of not causing the original object to grow with additional children. It has the disadvantage of causing the database to retrieve all the children which can take time when there are a huge amount.

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

        If there are a great number of objects you would not want to use one way embedding to keep the objects from becoming huge. If an object has a small amount of relationships, you could embed the relationships within the object. Third collection embedding is more effective for when there will be many relationships.
