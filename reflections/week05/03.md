## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

        Timeboxing is designating a specific amount of time to a specific task and planning to get it done within that timeframe. 

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

        1. I like the idea of planning your most daunting task for first so that you get it out of the way.
        2. I am going to download one the the apps and test the concept out.
        3. Deciding the day before which 3 things are the most important for the next day.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

        I think timeboxing could help with checkpoints and managing my time over the weekends. I could prioritize the more difficult or unexciting parts of the project and then once those are done, the rest will feel more fun and less stressful.
