## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

        Value type, reference type, and pointer type. Value types hold their value in their own memory space, reference type doesn't store its value directly, and pointer types don't inherit from object

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

        Value-type data types contain values. Some types I notice that aren't in JavaScript are byte, decimal, double, float, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort, etc.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

        Reference types store their value at another location and reference the address for that location. It's like assigning a value to a variable and then the variable gets set in memory as the address for the value it holds.
