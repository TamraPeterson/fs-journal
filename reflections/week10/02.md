## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

        A List is a grouping of any type. It can reference an object, class, integer, etc.

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

        The methods I anticipate using frequently are [index], Add, Contains, Find, FindIndex, Remove, ToArray, etc. These seem to be similar to methods we used often in javaScript.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

        I would probably use List[index] if i knew the specific index of the item I wanted. I could also use Find.
