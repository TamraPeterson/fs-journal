## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

        We used some of the principles from the reading such as using only one computer to code, checking each other's code, and communicating frequently. We took into account UX to try to make our site flow well. 

2. What went well this week?

        My partner and I communicated well and worked well together. We sketched things out on a whiteboard and made lists to follow so we knew what we still needed to work on and also what we had already accomplished. 

3. What would you do differently?

        There were times when things got confusing because we had so much going on. It was harder to keep track of what was connected where when both of us were involved with it. I think we could've benefited from some code notation to maybe label the top of files. We had a lot of nested components that could've benefited from a little note labeling where they were implemented.
