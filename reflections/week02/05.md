# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

        I really started to get the hang of things by the end of the week. Our partner project again went really well and I felt like I knew what to do for the most part. I really enjoyed the checkpoint project and felt like I learned a lot.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

        I was kind of surprised to learn that many job interviews include logical problems to solve that aren't related to coding. I'm also surprised at how crazy javascript gets in the advanced javascript videos. 

- What are you struggling with?

        I'm still struggling a bit with totally understanding how parameters and arguments work sometimes. I know what they are but sometimes writing the code for a little more complicated situations gets very confusing to me. I also have no idea what the heck is going on with for-in loops...Can't wrap my head around it yet.

- What would you count as a victory?

        I'm feeling pretty good about my checkpoint and felt really excited when I was able to figure things out on my own or through my own research.
