## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

        console.log() is a way to print anything to the console. It's useful just to check that things are working and to let you know what's happening in your code. console.error() is an error message letting you know that something isn't working right in your code. 

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

        The elements tab allows you to see all the html/css code. It can be useful because you can directly modify elements on your page in this area and see the immediate result. You can also click elements on your web page and it will show you the lines of code related to what you clicked.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

        You can run the debugger which takes you through the steps of your code one line at a time. This way you can see when issues are occurring as the code is being read.
