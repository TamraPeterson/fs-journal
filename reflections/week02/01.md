## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

        Scope is where the variables are available for use. A global scope means the variable is available 
        everywhere whereas some variables only have a scope of a single function and can therefore only be
        used within that function.

2. What is Hoisting ?

        Hoisting moves the variables and function declarations to the top of their scope before executing code.
        It makes them more available.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

        let is the preferred variable to const and var. var can be redefined indefinitely and const can never be redefined or updated. Let is the most functional because it can only be initially defined once, but can be updated.
