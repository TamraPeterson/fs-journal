## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

      When you make a plan before you start writing code, you can get a clearer picture of 
      what you want to do and break down the steps. This can help you come up with clear, simple,
      doable steps and work your way up.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

      I google it, check bootstrap docs, look at previous code where we did a similar thing
      and try to understand it better. I ask for another set of eyes to check my code and see
      if they know what I need to fix. Or walk away and come back later with fresh eyes and mind.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

      I think the biggest thing takeaway is that there will always be more to learn. We should be
      thankful for critiques from peers and superiors and use them as learning experiences. There
      are probably better ways to code a lot of what I'll know how to do as a beginner and as I
      learn from others and from researching, I will begin to learn how to use the better tools.
