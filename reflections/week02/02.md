## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

        A function declaration can be used before it's defined because it's hoisted. 
        A function expression is not hoisted and can't be used before it's defined.
        An arrow function is a shorter way to write a function expression.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

        Parameters are used to define a function and are the names created in the function within the parenthesis. They are separated by commas. 
        Arguments are the values given to the function from each parameter when the function is invoked. 

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

        Higher order functions are functions that have another function passed in as the parameter. Examples of this are when we used the 
        foreach() function or the filter() function within the other functions on the warehouse-manager.
