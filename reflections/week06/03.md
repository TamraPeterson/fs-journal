## Questions

1. What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?

        Lifecycle hooks include creation, mounting, updating, and destruction hooks. They help us know what's going on behind the scenes and when a component is created, added to the DOM, or updated or destroyed.

2. How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?

        We have used onMounted to perform an action for the start of a page. This makes it so that everytime the page is rendered, the data reflects that using onMounted.

3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?

        Mounting hooks allow us to access our components immediately before and after the first render. We can use it to access the DOM and modify it.
