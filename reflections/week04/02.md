## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

        Pending- Before the promise succeeds or fails it is pending.
        Resolved- When a promise is completed as promised.
        Rejected- A failed promise. Unsuccessful.

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

        Promises can help clean up code and make it easier to read. We can attach callbacks to promises.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

        .then() is what we do if a promise is successful and .catch() is what we do if the promise fails.
