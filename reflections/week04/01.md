> **ðŸ“– [Callback Hell](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk4/01-Callbacks)**

## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?

        A cause of Callback Hell is when people try writing JavaScript in a way where execution happens visually from top to bottom. A sign is a pyramid shape and many closing brackets and parenthesis at the end of the code.

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

        Asynchronous means that something takes time or doesn't happen until a future time. Callbacks basically say, okay let me work on that for you, and the code can continue while that thing is being worked on rather than stopping the code until it finishes.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

        1. Keep code shallow- name functions, and organize them.
        2. Modularize- write small modules(libraries) that each do one thing and put them in other modules that do a bigger thing.
        3. Handle every error- the best way to handle errors from callbacks is the node.js style.
